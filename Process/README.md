So far, after browsing the different tools, I’m leaning toward Ink as the scripting language. I have played games on the Pico-8 engine before, but the learning curve to making a game on it seems daunting. I feel most comfortable with front-end web languages, but.. I don’t know. I feel like a theatre major can better write a script than I can lmao. I’ve never been into the point-and-click branching narrative games and always found their origins pretty lame, but a compelling narrative is what often draws me in video games rather than game mechanics. I feel like I’m at a standstill haha. Let’s see how it goes.

Ok so I messed around with the basic tutorial on the inklestudios website. And realized I’m not good at learning stuff this way. So I generated a script where a person enters a door, and keep entering the same door endlessly. It currently does not have a an ending. I’m not sure I’ll leave it like this. But it is pretty funny you can’t actually get out of this singular branch that keeps repeating itself.

Hmm so people found it the game more experimental more than fun. I guess that was kinda the intention with stuff I make. I do still struggle to make things playful. I’d like to be able to take more risks with what I make and build more momentum. Although this was only a pass or fail assignment so hopefully I can make something as engaging with more interactivity.
